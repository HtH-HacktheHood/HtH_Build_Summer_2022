# Why are you interested in this dataset?

One of the greatest debates that happens among sports fan is whether or not their favorite players made enough of an impression on their respective leagues to be considered being inducted into the hall of fame. For a player to be eligible to be inducted into the hall of fame in the NBA, they have to have been retired for at least three years from the game. There are many notable players who have been inducted to the hall: Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, etcetera. However, there are a plethora of super talented players who have not been inducted into the hall: Shawn Kemp, Robert Horry, Tim Hardaway, Tom Chambers and Chauncey Billups just to name a few. The objective of this research experiment is to identify which factors most heavily influence whether or not an athlete will be inducted into the NBA hall of fame and ultimately use machine learning algorithms to predict how likely players are to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Keep in mind, the NBA Hall of Fame does not consist only of NBA players, but also NBA coaches, teams and some college coaches and teams as well. The goal of my analysis is to identify what factors influence hall of fame induction the heaviest and accurately predict what players may be inducted in the future.

Over the years there have been countless icons who have graced the hardwood and change the game of basketball for years to come. People like Wilt Chamberlin, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and more recently names like Lebron James, and Stephen Curry have revolutionized not only the way the game is played on the court, but also how the rest of the world receives the sport and its players off the court. Me being a fan and a player of the sport, I decide that I wanted to take a closer look at the statistics of the NBA and see if there are any relationships between certain aspects of a player's game or background and other stats or his overall success in the leauge.
